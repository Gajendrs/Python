# python prgramming Structure

step1 : commnts ---> to explain about your program

step2 :define user defined main function ---> we have to write logic 

sept3 : write main block ---> we have to call main function

# Python Operators:
---------------------

# operator :-
--------------
--------> operators are symblos which are used for to do the operations on data
---------> which are used for to process the data

# operation :-
--------------

----> the process of evaluting the equation

----> its combination ofoperators and data

# operands :-
-------------
----> what data which is involved in operationc

c = 10 +  34  ----> 10 , 34 , a are the operands

            ------->    +  , =  ---> operators


-----> The operators are classified based on two ways

#1. Based operands :-
------------------

----> the operator which may operating no of operands , based on the no of operands
    count  , the operators 2 types

    #1. unary operator
    -------------------
    the operator which is operating on single operand

        #example
    -------------

            + 2 -----> unary plus
            -5-------> unary minus
            not  5----> logical not

            ~ 5 ----> bitwise not 


   #2. Binary Operator
-----------------------

the operator which is operating two operands


example :-
----------


        arithmetic plus  ---> + , - ,* ,/ , % , &



       


#2. Based operations
---------------------

-----> operators are used for to solve the some kind  operations


1. arithmetic operators

2. relational operator

3. logical operators

4. assignments

5. bit wise operator

6. special operators
